This file contains some notes I took before writing the app, while I was figuring out how to scrape Google Books.

for book id ztQOAzZgyrwC:

get this
http://books.google.com/books?id=ztQOAzZgyrwC&pg=0&jscmd=click3
parse out all page numbers

for each page number
ie if page number is PA20
http://books.google.com/books?id=ztQOAzZgyrwC&lpg=PA20&pg=PA20&jscmd=click3
